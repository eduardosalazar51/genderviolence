	<h1>THE BRONX HAS THE MOST CHRONIC CASES OF GENDER-BASED VIOLENCE IN NYC </h1>
	<p> One in three women are victims of physical or sexual violence, some 736 million women worldwide. As part of the "16 Days of Activism Against Gender Violence" program, we review the statistics in the Bronx (and the rest of New York City), as we do so, the Bronx District Attorney's Office currently handles more than 1,300 cases related to this scourge.</p>

	<p> Saniyah Lawrence, 16, was murdered stabbed to the neck on Sunday, December 12. She was killed by her boyfriend, Zyaire Crumbley, 18. The reason? Jealousy. The young man - who is already in jail - killed her after a discussion. This did not happen in Ciudad Juarez, Cochabamba or Buenos Aires, this happened in New York, where the latest police report shows that in the New York metropolitan area there were 260,084 reports of domestic violence, about 700 calls a day.</p> 
	<p>This means, according to UN Women studies, that violence against women does not obey to culture, religion or a place, because it "always finds ways to adapt".</p> 
	<p>"While virtually everyone agrees that rape is terrible, sexual violence and harassment are normalized and trivialized," says the same UN Women report on rape culture, a term used since the feminist movement in the 1970s in US.</p> 
	<p>The Bronx is the NYC borough with the domestic violence highest rate. At least 9,500 cases were counted in 2021 by the Bronx District Attorney&#39;s office. In an analysis carried out for this report, with data from the police and the different district attorney&#39;s offices of the city, it was possible to contrast that also in chronic cases of domestic violence, which implies that the victim has been exposed for months or years to physical and psychological abuse - or even death - the Bronx is  the place with the most incidents (797) directly proportional to the number of population.</p>

	<p>The same police report on domestic violence indicates that black women are the most affected, accounting for 30% of homicides even though they constitute only 13% of the New York population. Hispanics are second on the list: 25.1% of the murders, although they make up 14.6% of the city&#39;s inhabitants according to statistics from the U.S. Census Bureau.</p> 
	<p>That's why Samantha Lagler, a social worker and women's rights advocate in the South Bronx, says "we have to come out...to stand up for our rights as women. â€œVictims need to know that they are not alone," she added. That is why there are different nonprofit, such as the National Organization for Women (NOW) to assist victims or those who are suffering some type of violence, whether physical, psychological or verbal. </p>
	<p>NY state has a law that criminalizes domestic violence and recognizes all victims regardless of race, color, religion, sex, age, entity, origin or immigration status or citizenship. Authorities urge victims - or people close to them - to report.</p>
